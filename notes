validating the data quality:

bad formatting:
fixed area values to not include the sqft and removed the /mo from the price values
also the links are just plain text not clickable, fixed by using hyperlink

duplicates:
there was no duplicates in the search results with the applied filters but just in case I
added the urls(unique keys) to a set to avoid this

missing data:
[UNFIXED]tried a diffrent search (for sale, diffrernt price range,5+ bedrooms, same zipcode) only the addresses were missing
